Meanwhile, the relevant conversations about how these websites work - their background systems and mechanisms, the influence they have, the ways in which they have shaped our past and present - are held elsewhere. Offsite.</p><p>In Site Visits we unpack digital culture topics including surveillance capitalism and the hidden control and power of algorithmic black boxes. We interrogate the power structures behind online spaces perceived to be “public” or “free”, the production of knowledge online, hidden biases and the complications of digital governance. And uniquely, we do so by using the website’s structural surface as the terrain, co-locating the website’s skin and the site of discourse. This combination and juxtaposition opens a new space for meaning and interpretation in an ecosystem overflowing with disparate sources of information .</p><p>Through worldbuilding and experiential storytelling, we expand our cultural imaginary and offer another way into synthesizing digital culture and materiality. We make very familiar places unfamiliar again, interrupting the passive gaze and consumption of sites that we visit frequently and spend hours on without thought. Through telling imagined and fantastic stories, and creating moments and gestures of worlds, we provide new visual languages, new stories and new starting points upon which to explore some of the most prominent themes and territories of our digital culture.</p><h2><em>Fulfilment Factory</em> - YouTube homepage</h2><p>Two of the core functions of YouTube’s algorithm are 1) sorting and ranking content, and 2) watching us watch that content. Through these functions, the algorithm aims for long-term “viewer satisfaction and engagement”, and ultimately, maximized watch time.</p><p>This algorithm is secret, proprietary, complicated, unknowable. It is a well-guarded secret. It impacts the media intake of billions. In Fulfilment Factory, we penetrate this black box. Drawing from the physical attributes of YouTube’s code structure, we turn the website into an industrial landscape, and its algorithm into the workers of this landscape. These workers watch you watching the content. They are literal tastemakers - sampling content not for what is good or bad, but for what might individually hold you captive. They are personal content shoppers, video sommeliers - here to match every unknown need.</p><h2><em>Irrigation Station</em> - Wikipedia entry for Encyclopedia</h2><p>Most of us take Wikipedia at face value - it has become our reliable go-to destination for day-to-day information. However, there are a multitude of both benevolent and self-interested forces at play in how this “public encyclopedia” evolves and is maintained.</p><p>In Irrigation Station, we imagine the accumulated growth of knowledge on a Wikipedia page, the elaborate infrastructure that enables this growth, and the various groups working through that infrastructure. Through this landscape, we reveal the website as a place of tensions: a place that is both wild and maintained, open and gated, vulnerable and guarded.</p><h2>LOOOOP</h2><p>LOOOOP is an ongoing collaboration between Boris Kourtoukov and Amelie Dinh. Merging our backgrounds in creative technology, media art, design and research we produce born-digital, interactive work that engages with the materiality of emerging technologies and the social underpinnings of our digital culture.</p><p>For additional updates follow the <a href="https://instagram.com/loooop.studio/">Loooop Studio Instagram</a>.</p></section></article><footer class="page-footer"><div>© 2021 Boris Kourtoukov</div></footer></div><nav class="static"><section class="main-links"> <a href="/">Index</a>   <a href="/details.html">Details</a> </section><aside class="additional"><span>MOD:2021-12-15</span> <span>·</span> <span><abbr title="3d20f3de1ca5b7ce5cc4a37b7d6de57bb02b3fa9">3d20f3de</abbr></span></aside></nav><noscript><article class="nojs">Good on you for not using javascript!</article></noscript></body></html>
