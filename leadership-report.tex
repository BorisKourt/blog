\begin{abstract}
\noindent
In his Distance essay Francisco Inchauste focuses on meaningful innovation and the concept of a Minimum Meaningful Product.
\end{abstract}

Technium is a key term that is introduced early and referenced throughout Inchauste's essay. It refers to the technium, a term coined by Kevin Kelly.
\begin{quote}
	The technium is an ecosystem with a behavior of its own, larger than the sum of modern art, social institutions and intellectual concepts.()
\end{quote}

This concept is described as our current reality, one where we use tools that we could never build ourselves. Tools that require the combined effort of hundreds or thousands in order to produce or understand. 

\newthought{With} this in tow the essay narrows it's focus on the burgeoning startup culture as it navigates the current state of the technium.

\section{Cultures of Innovation}

Inchauste argues that the current startup culture is too focused on the value of innovation for the sake of profit.

Perception of radical innovation (Not necessarily actual radical innovation)

Rush to fund teams without ideas

Large corporations have a hard time adapting to consumer needs.

profit and growth vs value and meaning

Startup trap: Money is only a single factor.

Investors make more than inventors. <- qft

Digital Landfills. Archiving and Longevity

Great Stagnation. Lack of plausible direction.

Industry Age -> Information age.

Yet the information age is actually declining in jobs. (Good 20k, Apl 14k, Twit 300)

High benefit for high skilled worker - no room for average person.

There needs to be a movement from differentiation to actually making a difference.

Profit should be a result not a goal.

Introduction of Eudaimonia `Living Well' By Aristotle. 

Life is not a technological ladder it is a cultural wheel. What we have gained in some places we have lost in others.

Key points:

Purpose, Belief, Moderation, Human Goals, Virtuous.

Process Cults. (Lean startup movement)

Minimum Viable Product - BAD

Users are collateral damage on the way to a better product.

Answers: Minimum Meaningful Product
- Chose better problems
- Improve People's Lives
- Solve blindness to tedious unpleasant tasks

Wicked Problems
- Insurmountable
- Unsolvable
- Need to be changed.

EVS

Minimum Meaningful Product has to put it's customers at its core.

Fore lasting meaningful connections

Building for ourselves = design myopia

Meaningful -> Sustainable

Products now have to be different to survive. Social media, environmental conciousness.

What will future explorers see in our technium cave?
